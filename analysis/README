This folder contains the R code for reproducing the ADNI and NJUI analyses in "Dai, Lin, Mueller (2019) Modelling Sparse Longitudinal Data on Riemannian Manifolds". 

After installing package dependencies, source the files "analysis/adniDemo.R" and "analysis/njuiDemo.R" in R to obtain the analytic results.
